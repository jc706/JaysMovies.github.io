			<p class=text-centered> Not every movie can be Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Some movies are destened to be Jason Bloom's Bio-dome, and that's okay. Bad movies can be fun. Good movies can be emotionally destroying. Who's to say one is good and one is bad? If you have fun watching a bad movie, then is it really that bad? </p>

			<p class=text-centered> Now for some of my background. My name is Jay and I have a The Associate of Applied Science degree in Digital Video & Cinema Production form Northwest Vista (San Antonio, Texas). Being a film studnt has not made me a film snob by anymeans. I hated The Graduate. Wanna fight about it? I am a staunch believer that most people are full of it. Some people just want to hop on the bad wagon when it comes to liking film. I aim tto formulate my own opinion. I like what I like. </p>
