			<p class=text-centered>Let me start by saying "Do as I say, not as I do. I did not pay for this movie. I watch a bootleg 480p version I found by chance on a skin flick website. I regret not watching this in a theater. I wanted to and just didn't set aside the time to go see it. I will be buyin the movie to make up for not paying to see it. My state of mind when watching this movie was one of indifference. I didn't want it to be bad. I didn't want it to be good. I just didn't want the movie to be spoiled by the hype train.</p>

			<p class=text-centered> I had a strong conceptof the marvel multi-verse from reading the comics. So following the movie was easy. Even if you didn't I feel that the movie makes it very dumbed down. Not that that's a bad thing. The story of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was was satisfying. No important post-credit scenes to remember. No requoired reading of comic book tie-ins. It was short but sweet. The animation had me worried before I started watching it. I soon forgot and enjoyed myself. The colors used made this movie really pop, though it was slightly distracting. It was not a deal breaker. Seeing Miles Moralas on the big screen (My P.C. monitor) was exciting for me. I never read Amazing Spider-man, and I didn't really get far into Peter Parker Ultiment Spider-man. I did however Read a fare bit of The Miles Moralas run. The thing they changed and kinda downplayed was in the comic book Miles' dad was super anti-superhero. In Spider-verse he seemed only mildly annoyed. Not all character changes were bad though. I would this movie is a strong 8 out of 10. and I am excited bout a posible sequel.<span class="blinking-cursor">|</span></p></p>
